The Tarot is a set of 78 cards. These 78 cards are comprised of two parts: 22 cards of the Major Arcana, and 56 cards of the Minor Arcana.

### The Major Arcana

Te Major Arcana are 22 cards that represent the seeker's journey to enlightenment. In divination, they represent major "fated" events or themes.

### The Minor Arcana

The modern 52-deck pack of playing cards started out as the Tarot's Minor Arcana. In divination, they represent events or themes that can be controlled by the seeker.
